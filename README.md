HashPash is a tool for encrypting users' text.

This program encrypts users' text using RSA encryption. After encrypting the text, you can send the hashed code to your intended recipient, who can then use the Pash section of the program to decrypt and view your message.

Usage Guide: You can generate your public and private keys using the RSA algorithm through the Generate Key tab. Share your public key with the person who will send you the confidential message, so they can enter your public key in the public key field and encrypt the message.

Note: The private key is used for decrypting the text and is automatically entered in the Pash section of the program. Never share your private key with anyone.

We strive to develop security applications to fill the gap left by today's society, which often overlooks security.
